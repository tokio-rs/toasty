## Writing Style

When writing or editing documentation:

- **Be fact-focused**: State what things are and what they do
- **Avoid buzzwords**: No "leverage", "synergy", "paradigm", etc.
- **Avoid fluff**: Every sentence should convey information
- **Avoid business jargon**: No "stakeholders", "deliverables", "action items"
- **Avoid weasel words**: No "very", "really", "quite", "somewhat"
- **Avoid dramatic terms**: No "critical", "crucial", "vital", "essential" unless something will actually break
- **Be direct**: Say what you mean without hedging
- **Use concrete examples**: Show, don't tell

### Examples

**Bad**: "This component is critical for ensuring optimal query performance."

**Good**: "This component optimizes queries by combining multiple database round-trips into one."

**Bad**: "The simplification phase leverages various transformations to enhance query efficiency."

**Good**: "The simplification phase rewrites association traversals into explicit subqueries."

## Document Structure
