# Toasty ORM - MVP Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the remaining features and improvements needed to reach MVP status for the Toasty ORM.

## Overview

Toasty aims to be an easy-to-use ORM for Rust that supports both SQL and NoSQL databases. To reach MVP status, we need to implement core features that web developers expect from a modern ORM.

> **📖 User Documentation:** See the [`guide/`](../guide/) directory for complete API documentation and usage examples.

## Next Steps

We are currently focusing on:
1. **Query Ordering, Limits & Pagination** - Essential for any data listing functionality

## Documentation Structure

This roadmap works alongside the user documentation:

- **Roadmap docs** (this directory): Technical implementation details, current state analysis, and development priorities
- **User guide** ([`guide/`](../guide/)): API documentation and usage examples for the target API (including unimplemented features)

Each roadmap document includes:
- Current state analysis
- Missing functionality
- Implementation roadmap
- Technical design decisions

Each guide document shows:
- Complete API examples (including future APIs marked as "work in progress")
- Usage patterns and best practices
- Integration examples
